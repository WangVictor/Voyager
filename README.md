# Team Members

Sudhir Nallam(psn240): Part-time master's student at CDS in last semester. I have 7+ years of work experience in coding with Python and Java. Presently I am working as software engineer at IBM Watson Research Center. I work on predictive analysis and deep learning. My interests are working in deep learning(NLP and/or Vision), Inference problems in unsupervised settings, time-series data and predictive analysis. Apart from core classes I have taken Deep Learning, NLP with Deep Learning, Inference and Representation etc., classes.

# Reason for Teaming Up

# Top 3 Project Choices

Any of the Breast cancer screening projects: In all the three projects we deal with major challege in computer vision, that is, handling high resolution images. In multi-view deep convolutional neural (MVDCN) network for breast screening done by prof. Kyunghyun Cho and Dr. Krzysztof J. Geras, handled this high resoltion images. By replicating their work, I will be coming up with a approach which would applied to multiple domains, where anomalies are hidden in high density data.  
Applied Bioinformatics Laboratories project: In this project we get a chance to apply deep learning technigues we learned to classifying the lung cancer sub-types.  
Capital One 2: In this project we develop the knowledge graph for major market events, which can be used in inference setting, as a querying database for policy movements and notable movements of particular market index.

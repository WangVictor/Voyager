# Team Members

Sudhir Nallam(psn240): Part-time master's student at CDS in last semester. I have 7+ years of work experience in coding with Python and Java. Presently I am working as software engineer at IBM Watson Research Center. I work on predictive analysis and deep learning. My interests are working in deep learning(NLP and/or Vision), Inference problems in unsupervised settings, time-series data and predictive analysis. Apart from core classes I have taken Deep Learning, NLP with Deep Learning, Inference and Representation etc., classes.

Xiaoyu Wang (xw1435): I'm currently a second year master of data science student at CDS. My background is in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. The past summer I was working with a project on ventricular tachycardia origins determination through modeling electrocardiogram signals both in supervised and unsupervised learning settings. My interest lies in interpreting and understanding deep neural networks. Aside from core courses, I also took topological data analysis and graph signal processing, which aims at exploring data analysis from a different approach. 

# Reason for Teaming Up

# Top 3 Project Choices

1. Any of the Breast cancer screening projects: In all the three projects we deal with major challege in computer vision, that is, handling high resolution images. In multi-view deep convolutional neural (MVDCN) network for breast screening done by prof. Kyunghyun Cho and Dr. Krzysztof J. Geras, handled this high resoltion images. By replicating their work, I will be coming up with a approach which would applied to multiple domains, where anomalies are hidden in high density data.  
2. Applied Bioinformatics Laboratories project: In this project we get a chance to apply deep learning techniques we learned to classifying the lung cancer sub-types.  
3. Capital One 2: In this project we develop the knowledge graph for major market events, which can be used in inference setting, as a querying database for policy movements and notable movements of particular market index.
